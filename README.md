# Moon player's guide

This repository contains a player's guide for the Japanese Mac and Windows game *Moon*, released by small indie studio OverRise in 1995. *Moon* is a strange and fascinating adventure game that's also very hard to play without knowing Japanese, and even Japanese-reading players can find themselves digging to understand its many hidden secrets. This player's guide was included in the Windows version of the game and includes solutions for all of the puzzles. I've included the original Japanese version and a rough translation which should allow English-speaking players to make it through the entire game.
